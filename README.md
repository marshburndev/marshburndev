My name is William but you can call me "Geoff".  I am completing my BS in Computer Science from SNHU in November with goals to transition to the Technology field within the upcoming year. I view myself as an enthusiastic problem solver and lifelong learner.  I am looking to deepen my knowledge and expand my skillset in the world of programming, software development and engineering.
