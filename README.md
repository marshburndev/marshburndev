My name is William but you can call me "Geoff".  I am completing my BS in Computer Science from SNHU in November with goals to transition to the Technology field within the upcoming year. I view myself as an enthusiastic problem solver and lifelong learner.  I am looking to deepen my knowledge and expand my skillset in the world of programming, software development and engineering.

### What am I doing? 

1. Aside from working a full-time job, I am currently learning AI and ML as well as Cloud Computing and migrating applications to AWS.  

2. I like to keep my skills sharp with competitive programming via Code Wars and Hacker Rank as well as building small projects from scratch, for fun.  

3. Learning never stops and while I continue to practice and apply my current skills, I look forward to plotting out a path for technologies and additional skills I need to learn for the future.
